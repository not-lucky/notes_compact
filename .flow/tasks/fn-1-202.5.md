# fn-1-202.5 Final Visual Quality Audit

## Description
Perform a final visual quality audit of all modified files. Verify that diagrams render correctly in monospaced fonts and that no "off by 1" issues were introduced during the enrichment phase.

**Size:** S
**Files:** All modified `.md` files

## Approach
- View modified files in a terminal viewer (like `cat` or Claude's viewer).
- Check for "jagged" edges in boxes or misaligned arrows.
## Acceptance
- [ ] No visual regressions in any modified diagram.
- [ ] All diagrams are verified to be high-quality and informative.
## Done summary
# fn-1-202.5 Final Visual Quality Audit

## Summary
Performed a comprehensive visual quality audit of all diagrams and flowcharts modified during the enrichment phase.

## Changes
- **Pattern Flowchart**: Realigned the Tree/Graph section which was significantly misaligned after widening boxes for complexity gates. Corrected the positioning of decision bridges (YES/NO) and arrows to ensure they are centered over their respective boxes.
- **Visual Consistency**: Verified that all new Unicode labels (memory addresses, indices, etc.) are properly spaced and do not cause "jagged" edges or overlapping lines.
- **Readability**: Confirmed that state transitions (e.g., Linked List reversal) are intuitive and clearly labeled.

## Verification
- Used python scripts to verify character-perfect alignment in the most complex ASCII diagrams.
- Manual verification of all modified markdown files to ensure high-quality rendering in monospaced environments.
