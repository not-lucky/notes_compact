# fn-1.6 Create Chapter 04: Linked Lists (8-10 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 04: Linked Lists with 8-10 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Linked list interview frequency
2. **01-linked-list-basics.md** - Node structure, traversal, operations
3. **02-fast-slow-pointers.md** - Cycle detection, find middle, nth from end
4. **03-reversal-patterns.md** - Reverse entire, reverse k-group, reverse between
5. **04-merge-lists.md** - Merge two sorted, merge k sorted
6. **05-intersection-detection.md** - Find intersection point
7. **06-palindrome-list.md** - Check if palindrome
8. **07-dummy-node-technique.md** - Using dummy nodes for edge cases
9. **08-copy-with-random.md** - Deep copy list with random pointer
## Acceptance
- [ ] Linked list basics covered
- [ ] Fast/slow pointer technique explained
- [ ] All reversal patterns included
- [ ] Merge operations covered
- [ ] Common interview problems addressed
- [ ] 8-10 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created Chapter 04: Linked Lists with comprehensive README and 8 section files
- Covered all core linked list patterns: basics, fast-slow pointers, reversal, merge, intersection, palindrome, dummy node, and deep copy
- Each section follows interview-focused template with complexity analysis, visual walkthroughs, and practice problems

**Why:**
- Linked lists are fundamental interview topics at FANG+ companies
- Patterns like fast-slow pointers and reversal appear frequently

**Verification:**
- All 9 markdown files created (1 README + 8 sections)
- Internal links validated
- Quick commands from epic spec executed successfully

**Follow-ups:**
- None - chapter complete
