# fn-1.8 Create Chapter 06: Trees (15-18 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 06: Trees with 15-18 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Tree problems interview frequency
2. **01-tree-basics.md** - Binary tree structure, properties
3. **02-tree-traversals.md** - Inorder, preorder, postorder (recursive + iterative)
4. **03-level-order-traversal.md** - BFS on trees, zigzag, bottom-up
5. **04-bst-operations.md** - Search, insert, delete in BST
6. **05-validate-bst.md** - Check if valid BST
7. **06-tree-construction.md** - Build tree from traversals
8. **07-lca-problems.md** - Lowest Common Ancestor (BST and BT)
9. **08-path-sum.md** - Path sum variants, all paths
10. **09-tree-depth.md** - Max depth, min depth, balanced check
11. **10-tree-diameter.md** - Diameter of binary tree
12. **11-symmetric-tree.md** - Check symmetric, same tree
13. **12-serialize-deserialize.md** - Tree serialization
14. **13-binary-tree-to-list.md** - Flatten tree to linked list
15. **14-bst-iterator.md** - Implement BST iterator
16. **15-kth-smallest.md** - Kth smallest in BST
## Acceptance
- [ ] All traversals covered (recursive + iterative)
- [ ] BST operations explained
- [ ] LCA pattern for both BST and BT
- [ ] Path sum problems covered
- [ ] Tree depth/diameter/balance
- [ ] Serialization pattern
- [ ] 15-18 markdown files created
## Done summary
## What Changed
- Created comprehensive Trees chapter with 16 markdown files
- All major tree patterns covered: traversals, BST ops, LCA, path sums, etc.
- Each file follows the established template with prerequisites, interview context, code examples, and practice problems

## Why
- Trees are among the most frequently tested topics at FANG+ (60-70% of interviews)
- Chapter provides foundation for graph algorithms
- Patterns covered are essential for interview success

## Verification
- All 16 files created and linked properly
- Quick commands from epic spec pass (file counts correct)
- Internal links verified (no broken references)
- Follows same style as previous chapters (ch04, ch05)

## Follow-ups
- None - chapter complete as specified
## Evidence
- Commits: 7d2f6db1aacf333ffa34047f87d3d6115b39806c
