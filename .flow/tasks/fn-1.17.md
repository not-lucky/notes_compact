# fn-1.17 Create Chapter 15: Bit Manipulation (6-8 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 15: Bit Manipulation with 6-8 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Bit manipulation overview
2. **01-binary-basics.md** - Binary representation, bitwise operators
3. **02-single-number.md** - Single number I, II, III
4. **03-counting-bits.md** - Count set bits, Hamming distance
5. **04-power-of-two.md** - Power of two, power of four
6. **05-xor-tricks.md** - XOR properties, missing number
7. **06-bit-manipulation-tricks.md** - Common bit tricks compendium
## Acceptance
- [ ] Binary basics covered
- [ ] XOR patterns explained
- [ ] Single number variants
- [ ] Bit counting patterns
- [ ] 6-8 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created Chapter 15: Bit Manipulation with 7 section files
- Covered binary basics, single number variants, counting bits, power of two, XOR tricks, and bit manipulation compendium
- Each section includes interview context, visualizations, multiple solutions, complexity analysis, and practice problems

Why:
- Completes bit manipulation topic essential for FANG interviews
- Follows established chapter template with consistent structure

Verification:
- 7 markdown files created (README + 6 sections)
- All internal links verified
- Structure matches previous chapters
