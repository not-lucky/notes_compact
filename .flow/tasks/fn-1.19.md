# fn-1.19 Enhance appendix-b Problem Patterns (4 files)

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
- Added "Building Intuition" sections to all 4 files (README, pattern-flowchart, when-to-use-what, template-code)
- Added "When NOT to Use" sections with anti-patterns and common mistakes
- Enhanced with mental models: diagnostic funnel, 80/20 rule, pattern vocabulary, skeleton+blanks

Why:
- Previous files jumped straight to content without explaining WHY patterns/structures work
- Users need intuition-building to adapt patterns to novel problems

Verification:
- grep confirms all 4 files now have "Building Intuition" and "When NOT to Use" sections
