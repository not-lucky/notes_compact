# fn-1.19 Create Chapter 17: System Design Basics (3-4 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 17: System Design Basics with 3-4 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Data structures for system design
2. **01-data-structure-choices.md** - When to use HashMap vs Tree vs Heap
3. **02-lru-cache.md** - LRU Cache implementation
4. **03-lfu-cache.md** - LFU Cache implementation
5. **04-rate-limiter.md** - Rate limiting data structures
## Acceptance
- [ ] Data structure trade-offs
- [ ] LRU Cache implementation
- [ ] LFU Cache implementation
- [ ] 3-4 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created Chapter 17: System Design Basics with 5 markdown files
- Covered data structure trade-offs, LRU cache, LFU cache, and rate limiter patterns
- All sections include full implementations, complexity analysis, and interview tips

**Why:**
- Bridges DSA knowledge with system design interviews
- Focuses on coding aspects of system design (LRU/LFU Cache, Rate Limiter)

**Verification:**
- 5 files created (README.md + 4 sections)
- Consistent format with other chapters
- Internal links validated
