# fn-1.18 Create Chapter 16: Math for Interviews (6-8 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 16: Math for Interviews with 6-8 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Math topics that appear in interviews
2. **01-gcd-lcm.md** - Euclidean algorithm, applications
3. **02-prime-numbers.md** - Primality check, sieve (small ranges)
4. **03-modular-arithmetic.md** - Mod operations, overflow handling
5. **04-random-sampling.md** - Reservoir sampling, shuffle
6. **05-sqrt-problems.md** - Integer square root, perfect square
7. **06-number-properties.md** - Palindrome number, reverse integer
## Acceptance
- [ ] GCD/LCM algorithms
- [ ] Prime numbers basics
- [ ] Modular arithmetic for interviews
- [ ] Random sampling covered
- [ ] 6-8 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created Chapter 16: Math for Interviews with 7 comprehensive markdown files
- Covered GCD/LCM, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, random sampling, sqrt problems, and number properties
- All sections include interview context, implementations, practice problems, and edge cases

**Why:**
