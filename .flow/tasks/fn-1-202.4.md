# fn-1-202.4 Enrich DS Diagrams with Memory and State Labels

## Description
Enrich data structure diagrams with state information. This includes adding array indices, abstract memory addresses for linked nodes, and showing the state of iteration variables (`i`, `j`, `prev`, `curr`) during algorithmic steps.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `03-hashmaps-sets/`, `04-linked-lists/`, `06-trees/`, `07-heaps-priority-queues/`

## Approach
- Label node boxes with simulated memory addresses (e.g., `[0x100]`).
- Show pointer movements across multiple ASCII "frames" or steps.
- Add index labels (0, 1, 2...) below or above array representations.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Linked list diagrams show node addresses and pointer connections.
- [ ] Heap/Array diagrams include clear 0-based indices.
- [ ] State transitions show variable values for at least one step.
## Done summary
# fn-1-202.4 Enrich DS Diagrams with Memory and State Labels

## Summary
Enriched data structure diagrams with memory addresses, array indices, and state information across multiple modules.

## Changes
- **Linked Lists**: Added memory addresses (e.g., `[0x100]`) to node diagrams in `04-linked-lists/01-linked-list-basics.md`. Updated the reversal mental model in `04-linked-lists/03-reversal-patterns.md` to show a clear step-by-step state transition of `prev`, `curr`, and `next_temp`.
- **Heaps**: Added 0-based array indices to both the array and tree representations in `07-heaps-priority-queues/01-heap-basics.md`.
- **Hashmaps**: Added indices and clear collision chain visualization with memory addresses in `03-hashmaps-sets/01-hash-table-basics.md`.
- **Trees**: Added memory address labels to tree node diagrams in `06-trees/01-tree-basics.md`.

## Verification
- Manual review of ASCII diagrams ensures they are properly aligned and include the requested technical details.
- Confirmed that the added labels enhance clarity without breaking the visual structure.
