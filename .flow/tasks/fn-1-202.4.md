# fn-1-202.4 Enrich DS Diagrams with Memory and State Labels

## Description
Enrich data structure diagrams with state information. This includes adding array indices, abstract memory addresses for linked nodes, and showing the state of iteration variables (`i`, `j`, `prev`, `curr`) during algorithmic steps.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `03-hashmaps-sets/`, `04-linked-lists/`, `06-trees/`, `07-heaps-priority-queues/`

## Approach
- Label node boxes with simulated memory addresses (e.g., `[0x100]`).
- Show pointer movements across multiple ASCII "frames" or steps.
- Add index labels (0, 1, 2...) below or above array representations.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Linked list diagrams show node addresses and pointer connections.
- [ ] Heap/Array diagrams include clear 0-based indices.
- [ ] State transitions show variable values for at least one step.
