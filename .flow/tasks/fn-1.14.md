# fn-1.14 Create Chapter 12: Greedy Algorithms (8-10 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 12: Greedy Algorithms with 8-10 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Greedy vs DP decision making
2. **01-greedy-basics.md** - When greedy works, proof techniques
3. **02-interval-scheduling.md** - Activity selection, maximum meetings
4. **03-merge-intervals.md** - Merge overlapping intervals
5. **04-meeting-rooms.md** - Meeting rooms I and II
6. **05-jump-game.md** - Jump game I and II
7. **06-gas-station.md** - Gas station problem
8. **07-candy-distribution.md** - Candy distribution
9. **08-partition-labels.md** - Partition labels
## Acceptance
- [ ] Greedy vs DP comparison
- [ ] Interval scheduling covered
- [ ] Classic greedy problems
- [ ] Proof techniques explained
- [ ] 8-10 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created Chapter 12: Greedy Algorithms with 9 comprehensive markdown files
- Covered greedy vs DP decision making, proof techniques (greedy stays ahead, exchange argument, contradiction)
- Implemented 8 core topics: greedy basics, interval scheduling, merge intervals, meeting rooms, jump game, gas station, candy distribution, partition labels
- Each file follows the interview-focused template with prerequisites, complexity tables, edge cases, practice problems

## Why
- Completes the Greedy Algorithms chapter as specified in fn-1.14
- Follows established chapter patterns from other completed chapters

## Verification
- All 9 markdown files created and verified
- Internal links checked and valid
- Cross-chapter prerequisite links verified
