5. **04-house-robber.md** - House robber variants
6. **05-coin-change.md** - Coin change I and II
7. **06-longest-increasing-subsequence.md** - LIS with O(n log n) solution
8. **07-2d-dp-basics.md** - Unique paths, minimum path sum
9. **08-longest-common-subsequence.md** - LCS and variants
10. **09-edit-distance.md** - Levenshtein distance
11. **10-knapsack-01.md** - 0/1 knapsack, partition equal subset
12. **11-knapsack-unbounded.md** - Unbounded knapsack
13. **12-palindrome-dp.md** - Longest palindromic substring/subsequence
14. **13-word-break.md** - Word break I and II
15. **14-regex-matching.md** - Wildcard and regex matching
16. **15-buy-sell-stock.md** - Stock problems (state machine DP)
17. **16-matrix-chain.md** - Matrix chain multiplication pattern
18. **17-burst-balloons.md** - Interval DP pattern
19. **18-dp-on-strings.md** - Distinct subsequences, interleaving

## Done summary
Created comprehensive Chapter 09: Dynamic Programming with 19 section files covering all major DP patterns for FANG+ interviews:

1. DP Fundamentals - Core properties, problem recognition
2. Memoization vs Tabulation - Top-down vs bottom-up comparison
3. 1D DP Basics - Fibonacci, climbing stairs, maximum subarray
4. House Robber - Linear, circular, and tree variants
5. Coin Change - Min coins and count ways
6. Longest Increasing Subsequence - O(n²) and O(n log n)
7. 2D DP Basics - Grid paths, minimum path sum
8. Longest Common Subsequence - String comparison
9. Edit Distance - Levenshtein distance
10. 0/1 Knapsack - Subset sum, partition problems
11. Unbounded Knapsack - Coin change, rod cutting
12. Palindrome DP - Substring, subsequence, partitioning
13. Word Break - Dictionary problems
14. Regex Matching - Wildcard and regex patterns
15. Buy & Sell Stock - State machine DP family
16. Matrix Chain - Interval DP introduction
17. Burst Balloons - Interval DP mastery
18. DP on Strings - Advanced string problems

Each file includes: interview context, state definition, recurrence relation, code with complexity, visual walkthroughs, edge cases, common mistakes, and practice problems.
