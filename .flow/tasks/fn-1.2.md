# fn-1.2 Enhance 08-graphs chapter (10 files)

## Description

Enhance all 10 markdown files in `08-graphs/` with deep explanations:

**Files to enhance:**
1. `01-graph-representations.md` - When to use adjacency list vs matrix
2. `02-bfs-basics.md` - Level-by-level intuition, wave propagation mental model
3. `03-dfs-basics.md` - Recursion tree visualization, backtracking concept
4. `04-topological-sort.md` - Dependency resolution intuition
5. `05-shortest-path.md` - Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford comparison and proof
6. `06-union-find.md` - Tree compression intuition, amortized analysis
7. `07-minimum-spanning-tree.md` - Cut property proof, Kruskal vs Prim
8. `08-graph-coloring.md` - Bipartite detection intuition
9. `09-strongly-connected.md` - Kosaraju/Tarjan explanation
10. `10-advanced-graph.md` - Network flow intuition

**Enhancements per file:**
- Add "Building Intuition" section with mental models (wave propagation for BFS, etc.)
- Add "When NOT to Use" section covering when simpler approaches work
- Expand all variations to 20-40 lines each
- Add step-by-step graph traversal traces with ASCII diagrams
- Include complexity derivation with proofs

## Acceptance

- [ ] All 10 files have "Building Intuition" section before code
- [ ] All 10 files have "When NOT to Use" section
- [ ] All variation sections expanded to 20+ lines
- [ ] ASCII graph traversal traces added
- [ ] Complexity proofs included
