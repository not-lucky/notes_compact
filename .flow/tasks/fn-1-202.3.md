# fn-1-202.3 Enrich Pattern Flowcharts with Complexity Gates

## Description
Enhance the high-level pattern flowcharts in `B-problem-patterns/` with more technical detail. This includes adding Big-O constraints to decision nodes and explicitly showing "failure paths" (where to go if a pattern doesn't apply).

**Size:** M
**Files:** `B-problem-patterns/01-pattern-flowchart.md`

## Approach
- Add text like `[Time: O(log N)]` or `[Space: O(1)]` into relevant boxes.
- Draw secondary arrows for fallback logic.
- Ensure added info doesn't break the new Unicode alignment.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Flowcharts in `B-problem-patterns/` contain complexity constraints.
- [ ] Decision nodes have clear "Yes" and "No" (or fallback) paths.
## Done summary
# fn-1-202.3 Enrich Pattern Flowcharts with Complexity Gates

## Summary
Enriched the 4 high-level ASCII pattern flowcharts in `B-problem-patterns/01-pattern-flowchart.md` with Big-O complexity gates and ensured clear decision paths (Yes/No/Fallback).

## Changes
- **Array Flowchart**: Added `[O(N)]` for Two Pointers/Sliding Window, `[O(log N)]` for Binary Search, and `[O(N log K)]` for Heap.
- **String Flowchart**: Added `[O(N)]` for Sliding Window/Hashmap, `[O(N²)]` for Expand Around Center, and `[O(N+M)]` for Pattern Matching.
- **Linked List Flowchart**: Added `[O(N)]` for Fast/Slow Pointers/Reversal and `[O(N+M)]` for Merge Pattern.
- **Tree/Graph Flowchart**: Added `[O(V+E)]` for BFS/DFS and `[O(ElogV)]` for Dijkstra. Widened boxes to accommodate complexity strings while maintaining Unicode alignment.

## Verification
- Visual audit of ASCII diagrams confirms correct alignment and readability.
- Decision paths (YES/NO) are preserved and consistent.
