# fn-1-202.3 Enrich Pattern Flowcharts with Complexity Gates

## Description
Enhance the high-level pattern flowcharts in `B-problem-patterns/` with more technical detail. This includes adding Big-O constraints to decision nodes and explicitly showing "failure paths" (where to go if a pattern doesn't apply).

**Size:** M
**Files:** `B-problem-patterns/01-pattern-flowchart.md`

## Approach
- Add text like `[Time: O(log N)]` or `[Space: O(1)]` into relevant boxes.
- Draw secondary arrows for fallback logic.
- Ensure added info doesn't break the new Unicode alignment.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Flowcharts in `B-problem-patterns/` contain complexity constraints.
- [ ] Decision nodes have clear "Yes" and "No" (or fallback) paths.
## Done summary
TBD
