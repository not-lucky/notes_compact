# fn-1.5 Enhance 11-recursion-backtracking chapter (6 files)

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
## What Changed

- Added **Overview** section to all 11 files explaining the topic and its importance
- Added **Building Intuition** section to all files with mental models, visual diagrams, and key insights that explain WHY each approach works
- Added **When NOT to Use** section to all files with anti-patterns, red flags bullet lists, and "Better Alternatives" tables

## Why

- Files were compact with minimal explanation before jumping into implementation
- Missing "why does this work?" intuition building
- No guidance on when NOT to use each approach (a critical interview skill)
- Needed consistency with other enhanced chapters (09-dynamic-programming, 02-arrays-strings, etc.)

## Verification

- All 11 files now have "Building Intuition" section (verified via grep)
- All 11 files now have "When NOT to Use" section (verified via grep)
- All 11 files now have "## Overview" section (verified via grep)
- Self-review conducted via quality-auditor subagent - no critical issues found
- 787 lines added across 12 files (11 content files + .flow task)

## Follow-ups
