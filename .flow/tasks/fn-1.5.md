# fn-1.5 Create Chapter 03: HashMaps & Sets (8-10 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 03: HashMaps & Sets with 8-10 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Hash table importance in interviews
2. **01-hash-table-basics.md** - How hashing works, collision handling
3. **02-two-sum-pattern.md** - Two sum and generalizations
4. **03-frequency-counting.md** - Counter patterns, top K elements
5. **04-anagram-grouping.md** - Group anagrams, valid anagram
6. **05-subarray-sum-hashmap.md** - Subarray sum equals K pattern
7. **06-set-operations.md** - Intersection, union, difference
8. **07-design-hashmap.md** - Implement your own HashMap
9. **08-advanced-patterns.md** - LRU cache, random pick
## Acceptance
- [ ] Hash table fundamentals covered
- [ ] Two-sum pattern and variants explained
- [ ] Frequency counting patterns included
- [ ] Subarray sum with hashmap pattern
- [ ] LRU cache design problem covered
- [ ] 8-10 markdown files created
## Done summary
## What changed
- Created Chapter 03: HashMaps & Sets with 9 comprehensive markdown files
- All files follow the established section template with interview context, patterns, and practice problems
- Content covers hash table internals, two-sum pattern, frequency counting, anagram grouping, subarray sum patterns, set operations, HashMap design, and advanced patterns (LRU cache, RandomizedSet)

## Why
- HashMaps are foundational for 40-50% of interview problems
- These patterns (two-sum, frequency counting, LRU cache) are FAANG interview staples
- Each section provides interview-focused templates with complexity analysis

## Verification
- Ran `find . -name "*.md" | wc -l` to verify file counts
- Chapter 03 has 9 files (README + 8 sections) as specified
- All sections follow consistent format with prerequisites, templates, edge cases, and practice problems

## Follow-ups
- None - chapter is complete per acceptance criteria
