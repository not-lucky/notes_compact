# fn-1.4 Create Chapter 02: Arrays & Strings (15-18 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 02: Arrays & Strings with 15-18 files covering:

## Core Patterns (files):
1. **README.md** - Chapter overview, pattern frequency in interviews
2. **01-array-basics.md** - Array operations, traversal, rotation
3. **02-two-pointers-same-direction.md** - Fast/slow pointers, remove duplicates
4. **03-two-pointers-opposite.md** - Container with most water, 3sum
5. **04-sliding-window-fixed.md** - Maximum sum subarray of size k
6. **05-sliding-window-variable.md** - Longest substring without repeating chars
7. **06-prefix-sum.md** - Range sum queries, subarray sum equals k
8. **07-difference-array.md** - Range update operations
9. **08-kadanes-algorithm.md** - Maximum subarray, variants
10. **09-string-basics.md** - String operations, comparison, manipulation
11. **10-string-matching.md** - Substring search, pattern matching basics
12. **11-anagram-problems.md** - Valid anagram, group anagrams
13. **12-palindrome-strings.md** - Check palindrome, longest palindromic substring
14. **13-matrix-traversal.md** - Spiral order, rotate matrix, search 2D
15. **14-in-place-modifications.md** - Move zeroes, remove element, sort colors
16. **15-interval-problems.md** - Merge intervals, insert interval

## Each file includes:
- Pattern explanation with visual ASCII diagrams
- Template code in Python
- 3-5 practice problems with difficulty
- Common edge cases
- Time/space complexity analysis
## Acceptance
- [ ] README.md with interview frequency context
- [ ] Two-pointer patterns covered (same and opposite direction)
- [ ] Sliding window patterns covered (fixed and variable)
- [ ] Prefix sum and difference array explained
- [ ] Kadane's algorithm with variants
- [ ] String manipulation patterns included
- [ ] Matrix traversal patterns included
- [ ] 15-18 markdown files created
- [ ] Each file has practice problems table
- [ ] All code is Python with complexity annotations
## Done summary
- Created 16 markdown files for Chapter 02: Arrays & Strings (README + 15 sections)
- Covered all major patterns: two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum, difference array, Kadane's, string manipulation, anagrams, palindromes, matrix traversal, in-place modifications, intervals
- Each file follows the interview-focused template with pattern explanations, code templates, visual diagrams, complexity analysis, and practice problems

- Why: This chapter covers the most frequently tested data structures in FANG+ interviews (60-70% of coding questions)
- All section files include clear Python implementations with time/space complexity annotations

- Verification: Created 16 .md files in 02-arrays-strings/; validated file structure matches epic spec requirements (15-18 files)
- No follow-ups needed for this task
