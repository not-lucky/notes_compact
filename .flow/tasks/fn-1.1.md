# fn-1.1 Enhance 09-dynamic-programming chapter (9 files)

## Description

Enhance all 9 markdown files in `09-dynamic-programming/` with deep explanations:

**Files to enhance:**
1. `01-dp-fundamentals.md` - Add intuition for recognizing DP problems
2. `02-1d-dp.md` - Expand with visual state transitions
3. `03-2d-dp.md` - Add grid traversal visualizations
4. `04-dp-on-strings.md` - Explain edit distance intuition deeply
5. `05-knapsack-patterns.md` - Full derivation of bounded/unbounded variants
6. `06-subsequence-dp.md` - LIS/LCS with step-by-step traces
7. `07-state-machine-dp.md` - State diagrams and transitions
8. `08-interval-dp.md` - Matrix chain intuition
9. `09-dp-optimization.md` - When and why optimizations work

**Enhancements per file:**
- Add "Building Intuition" section (10-20 lines) explaining WHY the approach works
- Add "When NOT to Use" section (5-10 lines) covering anti-patterns
- Expand all variations to 20-40 lines each (not 2-3 lines)
- Add complexity derivation with step-by-step proof
- Add visual traces showing DP table fills

## Acceptance

- [ ] All 9 files have "Building Intuition" section before code
- [ ] All 9 files have "When NOT to Use" section
- [ ] All variation sections expanded to 20+ lines
- [ ] Complexity sections include derivation
- [ ] Visual DP table traces added where applicable
