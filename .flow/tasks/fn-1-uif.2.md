# fn-1-uif.2 Mirror folder 02-arrays-strings

## Description
Mirror the content of the `02-arrays-strings` folder into the `solutions/02` directory. This involves creating mirrored markdown files with Python implementations for all practice problems mentioned in the original notes.

## Acceptance
- [x] Create mirrored solution files in `solutions/02/`
- [x] Implement Python code blocks for all practice problems in Chapter 02
- [x] Add a `README.md` for `solutions/02/`
- [x] Verify syntax for all new Python code blocks

## Done summary
Implemented practice problem solutions for the Arrays & Strings chapter (folder 02), covering basic operations, two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums, Kadane's algorithm, strings, matrix traversal, in-place modifications, and intervals. All 15 subtopics are represented with optimal Python implementations.

## Evidence
- Commits: Created mirrored files in `solutions/02/`
- Tests: Verified Python syntax for all 28 new code blocks using `verify_syntax.py`
- PRs: N/A
