# fn-1.12 Create Chapter 10: Binary Search (8-10 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 10: Binary Search with 8-10 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Binary search patterns overview
2. **01-binary-search-template.md** - Standard template, why it works
3. **02-first-last-occurrence.md** - Finding boundaries
4. **03-search-rotated-array.md** - Search in rotated sorted array
5. **04-find-minimum-rotated.md** - Find minimum in rotated array
6. **05-peak-element.md** - Find peak element
7. **06-search-space.md** - Binary search on answer (capacity, koko)
8. **07-matrix-search.md** - Search in 2D matrix
9. **08-median-two-arrays.md** - Median of two sorted arrays
## Acceptance
- [ ] Binary search template explained
- [ ] Boundary finding patterns
- [ ] Rotated array variants covered
- [ ] Search space binary search
- [ ] Matrix search included
- [ ] 8-10 markdown files created
## Done summary
## What changed
- Created comprehensive Binary Search chapter (Chapter 10) with 9 markdown files
- README provides chapter overview, patterns, and complexity analysis
- 8 detailed sections covering all major binary search patterns

## Why
- Binary search is a foundational algorithm appearing in ~20% of FANG+ interviews
- Covers classic patterns and advanced techniques (search space, median of two arrays)
- Interview-focused with problem tables, edge cases, and tips

## Verification
- All 9 files created successfully (README + 8 sections)
- File structure follows established chapter patterns
- Internal links verified
- Git commit successful

## Follow-ups
- None - chapter complete with all specified content
