# fn-2-knl.5 Implement Strategy Layer & Final Polish

## Description
Elevate the existing content by adding "Meta-Cognitive" strategies, "System Design" connectors, and upgrading visuals.

## Scope
1.  **Metric-Driven Strategy**:
    *   Add "Constraint Analysis" cheat sheet (`N <= 20` -> `O(2^N)`, etc.).
2.  **Pattern Connectivity**:
    *   Link generic DSA patterns to real-world System Design components.
    *   Example: Tries -> Typeahead Search / IP Routing.
    *   Example: HashMaps -> Distributed Cache / Sharding.
3.  **Visuals**:
    *   Replace key ASCII diagrams with Mermaid.js charts for better readability.
    *   Add "Decision Trees" for choosing the right algorithm.

## Definition of Done
- [x] `A-python-cheatsheet/constraint_analysis.md` created.
- [x] Strategy sections ("Intuition", "When to use") audited and improved in core modules (Arrays, Graphs, DP).
- [x] System Design links added to corresponding data structures.
- [x] At least 10 major Mermaid.js diagrams added across the repo.

## Done summary
