# fn-1-202.2 Standardize Unicode Glyphs and Fix Alignment

## Description
Apply the Unicode box-drawing standard globally. Fix all "off by 1" misalignment issues by ensuring boxes are correctly sized and text is properly centered or padded.

**Size:** M
**Files:** All `.md` files identified in fn-1-202.1

## Approach
- Replace legacy characters (`+`, `-`, `|`) with Unicode glyphs (`┌`, `─`, `┐`, `│`).
- Adjust spacing to ensure vertical bars align perfectly across lines.
- Standardize box widths (prefer odd numbers for centered connectors).
## Acceptance
- [ ] All boxes in diagrams use consistent Unicode glyphs.
- [ ] No visual misalignment (off by 1) remains in the surveyed files.
## Done summary
TBD
