# fn-1-uif.1 Mirror folder 01-complexity-analysis

## Description
Mirror the notes from `01-complexity-analysis` to the `solutions/` directory. Create solution markdown files for each note file that contains practice problems.
## Acceptance
- [ ] `solutions/01-complexity-analysis/` directory created.
- [ ] Solution files created for all notes in `01-complexity-analysis` that have practice problems.
- [ ] Solution files follow the format (Problem Statement, Constraints, Example, Python block).
- [ ] `python verify_syntax.py` passes for all solutions.
## Done summary
Mirrored 01-complexity-analysis notes to solutions/01-complexity-analysis/. Created solution markdown files for Big-O fundamentals, time/space complexity, common patterns, and interview tips. Each file includes problem statements, constraints, examples, and valid Python implementations. Verified all Python code blocks using verify_syntax.py.
