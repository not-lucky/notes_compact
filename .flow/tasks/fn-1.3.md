# fn-1.3 Create Chapter 01: Complexity Analysis (5-6 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 01: Complexity Analysis with 5-6 files covering:

## Files to create:
1. **README.md** - Chapter overview, why complexity matters in interviews
2. **01-big-o-notation.md** - Big-O fundamentals, common classes (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2^n))
3. **02-time-complexity.md** - Analyzing loops, nested loops, recursive calls
4. **03-space-complexity.md** - Stack space, auxiliary space, in-place algorithms
5. **04-common-patterns.md** - Complexity of common operations (array, hash, tree, etc.)
6. **05-interview-tips.md** - How to discuss complexity with interviewers, trade-off discussions

## Each file includes:
- Clear explanations with examples
- Python code snippets showing complexity analysis
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Practice identifying complexity
## Acceptance
