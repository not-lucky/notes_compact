# fn-1.3 Create Chapter 01: Complexity Analysis (5-6 files)

## Description
Create Chapter 01: Complexity Analysis with 5-6 files covering:

## Files to create:
1. **README.md** - Chapter overview, why complexity matters in interviews
2. **01-big-o-notation.md** - Big-O fundamentals, common classes (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2^n))
3. **02-time-complexity.md** - Analyzing loops, nested loops, recursive calls
4. **03-space-complexity.md** - Stack space, auxiliary space, in-place algorithms
5. **04-common-patterns.md** - Complexity of common operations (array, hash, tree, etc.)
6. **05-interview-tips.md** - How to discuss complexity with interviewers, trade-off discussions

## Each file includes:
- Clear explanations with examples
- Python code snippets showing complexity analysis
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Practice identifying complexity
## Acceptance
- [ ] README.md with chapter overview
- [ ] Big-O notation fundamentals covered
- [ ] Time complexity analysis explained
- [ ] Space complexity analysis explained
- [ ] Common data structure complexities table
- [ ] Interview discussion tips included
- [ ] 5-6 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created Chapter 01: Complexity Analysis with 6 comprehensive section files
- README.md: Chapter overview, core concepts table, common complexity classes, interview mistakes
- 01-big-o-notation.md: Big-O fundamentals, all complexity classes with Python examples
- 02-time-complexity.md: Loop analysis, recursion analysis, Master theorem basics
- 03-space-complexity.md: Stack space, in-place algorithms, space-time trade-offs
- 04-common-patterns.md: Python built-in type complexities, data structure comparisons
- 05-interview-tips.md: How to communicate complexity, trade-off discussions, practice scenarios

Why:
- Foundational chapter for all subsequent DSA topics
- Interview-focused with practical examples and common mistakes

Verification:
- All 6 files created and verified (ls shows 6 .md files)
- Structure validation passed via quick commands
- Internal links validated
