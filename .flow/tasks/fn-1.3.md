# fn-1.3 Enhance 06-trees chapter (9 files)

## Description

Enhance all 9 markdown files in `06-trees/` with deep explanations:

**Files to enhance:**
1. `01-tree-basics.md` - Tree terminology and properties
2. `02-binary-tree-traversals.md` - Recursive vs iterative intuition
3. `03-bst-operations.md` - BST property exploitation
4. `04-tree-construction.md` - From traversals, uniqueness proofs
5. `05-path-problems.md` - DFS for paths, global vs local state
6. `06-lca-problems.md` - Binary lifting, Euler tour intuition
7. `07-tree-dp.md` - Post-order for DP, rerooting technique
8. `08-balanced-trees.md` - AVL/Red-Black rotation intuition
9. `09-trie.md` - Prefix tree space-time tradeoffs

**Enhancements per file:**
- Add "Building Intuition" section explaining tree recursion patterns
- Add "When NOT to Use" section (when arrays/graphs are better)
- Expand all variations with full derivations
- Add ASCII tree diagrams showing transformations
- Include complexity analysis with tree height considerations

## Acceptance

- [ ] All 9 files have "Building Intuition" section before code
- [ ] All 9 files have "When NOT to Use" section
- [ ] All variation sections expanded to 20+ lines
- [ ] ASCII tree diagrams added for operations
- [ ] Complexity analysis includes height discussions
