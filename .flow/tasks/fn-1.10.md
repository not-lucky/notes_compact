## Done summary
Created comprehensive Chapter 08: Graphs with 19 section files covering all major graph patterns for FANG+ interviews:

1. Graph representations (adjacency list/matrix, edge list, grid as graph)
2. BFS fundamentals with template and applications
3. DFS fundamentals with recursive/iterative approaches
4. Connected components and Number of Islands pattern
5. Cycle detection for directed graphs (three-color algorithm)
6. Cycle detection for undirected graphs (parent tracking, Union-Find)
7. Topological sort (Kahn's and DFS-based)
8. Course Schedule I and II deep dive
9. Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted shortest paths
10. Bellman-Ford for negative edge weights
11. Shortest path in unweighted graphs (BFS, 0-1 BFS)
12. Clone Graph deep copy pattern
13. Grid/island problems as implicit graphs
14. Multi-source BFS (Rotting Oranges)
15. Word Ladder and implicit graph BFS
16. Bipartite graph checking (two-coloring)
17. Alien Dictionary (topological sort from constraints)
18. Network Delay Time (Dijkstra application)

Each file includes: prerequisites, interview context, core concepts, Python code with complexity analysis, visual walkthroughs, edge cases, common mistakes, and practice problems.
