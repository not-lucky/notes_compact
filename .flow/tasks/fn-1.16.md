# fn-1.16 Enhance 16-math chapter (7 files)

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
## What Changed
- Enhanced all 7 files in 16-math-basics chapter with "Building Intuition" sections containing mental models and analogies
- Added "When NOT to Use" sections covering anti-patterns and when algorithms shouldn't be used
- Expanded explanations with derivations, common pitfalls, and practical guidelines

## Why
- Files previously jumped directly to content without building intuition
- Missing guidance on when NOT to apply certain algorithms
- Following the enhanced template from the epic spec to make content more educational

## Verification
- Verified all 7 files have "Building Intuition" section (7/7)
- Verified all 7 files have "When NOT" section (7/7)
- Commit includes 343+ lines of additions across 8 files
## Evidence
- Commits: c3fe230
