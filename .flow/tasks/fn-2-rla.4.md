## Description
Process note files in folders `11` to `17`.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `solutions/11-*` to `solutions/17-*`

## Approach
- Parse `## Practice Problems` tables for Recursion, Greedy, Tries, Union Find, Bit Manipulation, Math, and System Design.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Solutions for folders 11-17 are created in `solutions/`.
## Done summary
