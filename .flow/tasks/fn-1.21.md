# fn-1.21 Create Appendix B: Problem Patterns Guide (3-4 files)

## Description
Create Appendix B: Problem Patterns Guide with 3-4 files:

## Files:
1. **README.md** - Pattern recognition overview
2. **01-pattern-flowchart.md** - Decision tree for pattern selection
3. **02-when-to-use-what.md** - Data structure/algorithm selection guide
4. **03-template-code.md** - Template code for each major pattern
## Acceptance
- [ ] Pattern recognition flowchart
- [ ] "When to use what" guide
- [ ] Template code for patterns
- [ ] 3-4 markdown files created
## Done summary
- Created 4 markdown files for Appendix B: Problem Patterns Guide
- README.md: Overview of 15 core patterns with complexity summary and interview strategy
- 01-pattern-flowchart.md: ASCII decision trees for array, string, linked list, tree/graph, and math problems
- 02-when-to-use-what.md: Data structure selection guide with constraint-based selection (n size hints)
- 03-template-code.md: Copy-paste templates for 14 major patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, BFS, DFS, Backtracking, DP, Monotonic Stack, Heap, Union-Find, Trie, Graph algorithms, Linked List, Intervals)

Why:
- Provides quick pattern recognition framework for interview preparation
- Templates reduce time spent on boilerplate during interviews

Verification:
- 4 files created in B-problem-patterns/ directory
- All files follow consistent formatting with tables and code blocks
