# fn-1.21 Enhance solutions directory (32 files)

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
- Added "Building Intuition" sections to all 33 files (32 solutions + README)
- Added "When NOT to Use" sections with pattern-specific pitfalls and alternatives
- Each solution now includes: Why This Works, How to Discover This, Pattern Recognition
- README enhanced with three-phase learning model (struggle, understand, rebuild)

Why:
- Previous solutions explained WHAT the code does but not WHY it works
- Users need to understand the core insight to adapt patterns to new problems
- Pattern recognition sections connect individual solutions to broader themes

Verification:
- grep confirms all 33 files now have "Building Intuition" and "When NOT to Use" sections
