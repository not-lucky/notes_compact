# fn-1.15 Enhance 01-complexity chapter (6 files)

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
## What Changed
- Enhanced all 6 files in 01-complexity-analysis chapter with "Building Intuition" sections containing mental models and analogies
- Added "When NOT to Use/Overthink" sections covering anti-patterns and when complexity analysis shouldn't be overdone
- Expanded explanations with visual examples, derivations, and practical guidelines

## Why
- Files previously jumped directly to content without building intuition
- Missing guidance on when NOT to apply certain thinking patterns
- Following the enhanced template from the epic spec to make content more educational

## Verification
- Verified all 6 files have "Building Intuition" section (6/6)
- Verified all 6 files have "When NOT" section (6/6)
- Commit includes 300+ lines of additions across 7 files
