# fn-2-knl.2 Implement Range Queries & Advanced Graphs

## Description
implement data structures for efficient range queries and advanced graph traversals required for hard algorithmic challenges.

## Scope
1.  **Range Queries**:
    *   **Segment Trees**: Construction, Point Update, Range Query. Lazy Propagation for Range Updates.
    *   **Fenwick Tree (BIT)**: Implementation for prefix sums and updates.
    *   **Sparse Table**: Static Range Minimum Query (RMQ) in `O(1)`.
2.  **Advanced Graphs**:
    *   **Tarjan's Algorithm**: Finding SCCs (Strongly Connected Components), Bridges, and Articulation Points.
    *   **Binary Lifting**: For LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) in `O(log N)`.
    *   **Euler Tour**: Flattening trees for subtree queries.
