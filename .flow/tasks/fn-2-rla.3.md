# fn-2-rla.3 Implement Mirroring for Folders 06-10

## Description
Process note files in folders `06` to `10`.

**Size:** M
**Files:** `solutions/06-*` to `solutions/10-*`

## Approach
- Similar to Task 2, parse `## Practice Problems` tables.
- Generate Python solutions for Trees, Heaps, Graphs, DP, and Binary Search.
## Acceptance
- [ ] Solutions for Trees, Heaps, Graphs, DP, and Binary Search are created in `solutions/`.
- [ ] Tree solutions include `TreeNode` definitions if necessary.
## Done summary
Implemented comprehensive practice problem solutions for modules 06 through 10 (Trees, Heaps, Graphs, DP, and Binary Search). Solutions follow the established project structure and provide clear, optimized Python implementations for core FANG+ interview patterns.
