# fn-1.20 Enhance appendix-c Company Patterns (5 files)

## Description
TBD

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
- Added "Building Intuition" sections to all 5 files (README, Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft/Apple)
- Added "When NOT to Use" sections with company-specific pitfalls and mistakes
- Enhanced with mental models: interview-as-cultural-sample, LP lens, ship-iterate cycle, two cultures

Why:
- Previous files explained what companies look for but not WHY their interviews are designed that way
- Users need deeper understanding to adapt strategies naturally rather than mechanically

Verification:
- grep confirms all 5 files now have "Building Intuition" and "When NOT to Use" sections
