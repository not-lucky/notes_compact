# Standardize and Enhance ASCII Diagrams (fn-1-202)

## Overview
This epic aims to standardize all visual documentation across the repository by fixing alignment issues, adopting a consistent Unicode box-drawing style, and enriching diagrams with critical technical information (Big-O constraints, pointer states, memory labels).

The project explicitly avoids Mermaid in favor of highly portable ASCII/Unicode art that renders correctly in any monospaced text environment.

## Scope
- **Standardization**: Convert all ASCII diagrams to use Unicode box-drawing glyphs (`┌`, `─`, `┐`, `│`, etc.).
- **Alignment**: Fix "off by 1" misalignment caused by variable-width characters, tabs, or manual editing errors.
- **Enrichment**:
    - **Flowcharts**: Add complexity gates (Time/Space constraints) and explicit failure paths.
    - **Data Structures**: Add indices, abstract memory addresses (e.g., `0x100`), and variable snapshots (`i`, `j`, `prev`, `curr`).
- **Audit**: Verify rendering across major monospaced font environments.

## Approach
1.  **Grid-Based Alignment**: All diagrams will follow a virtual grid. Boxes will typically have odd-numbered widths for centered connections.
2.  **Unicode Set**: Standardize on the "Light" Unicode box-drawing set for clarity and compatibility.
3.  **Variable Context**: Diagrams illustrating algorithms must show the state of pointers or indices during key transitions.
4.  **No Mermaid**: Ensure no Mermaid syntax is introduced; stick to raw code blocks with `text` or no language hint.

## Detailed Phases
- **Phase 1: Foundation**: Create a baseline list of all diagram locations and identify specific misalignment patterns.
- **Phase 2: Flowchart Overhaul**: Focus on `B-problem-patterns/` to add complexity-based decision logic.
- **Phase 3: DS & Algorithm Visualization**: Enhance data structure diagrams in `03-hashmaps-sets/`, `04-linked-lists/`, `06-trees/`, and `07-heaps-priority-queues/`.
- **Phase 4: Global Consistency Pass**: Final audit of all remaining `.md` files (like `README.md` and smaller cheatsheets).

## Risks + Mitigations
- **Risk**: Unicode characters might not render in some legacy environments.
    - **Mitigation**: Use only the "Light" set which is widely supported in modern terminals and web viewers.
- **Risk**: Wide diagrams break on small screens.
    - **Mitigation**: Keep flowchart width within 80-100 characters where possible, or split into logical sub-diagrams.

## Non-functional Targets
- **Portability**: Diagrams must look identical in GitHub UI, VS Code, and standard terminal `cat`/`bat` output.
- **Educational Value**: Every diagram should answer a "Why" or "How" question that the text alone might miss.

## Quick commands
```bash
# Find all files with triple-backtick blocks that might contain diagrams
grep -r "```" . --include="*.md"

# Check for common misalignment markers
grep -r "|" . --include="*.md" | grep -v "Table"
```

## Acceptance
- [ ] Every `.md` file has been reviewed for diagrams.
- [ ] All boxes use consistent Unicode glyphs (`┌─┐`).
- [ ] No "off by 1" misalignment exists in any diagram.
- [ ] Flowcharts include Big-O constraints for decision points.
- [ ] Data structure diagrams show pointer/index states for algorithmic steps.
- [ ] No Mermaid blocks are present in the codebase.
