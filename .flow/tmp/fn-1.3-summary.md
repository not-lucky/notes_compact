# Task fn-1.3 Completion Summary

## What was done

Enhanced 9 markdown files in `06-trees/` with deep explanations, totaling 776 new lines of content.

### Files enhanced:
1. `01-tree-basics.md` - Organizational chart mental model, height vs depth explanation
2. `02-tree-traversals.md` - Visit order mental model, when to use each traversal
3. `03-level-order-traversal.md` - Burning building mental model, level size trick
4. `04-bst-operations.md` - Sorted bookshelf model, deletion case visualizations
5. `05-validate-bst.md` - Bouncer at the door model, range constraint insight
6. `06-tree-construction.md` - Detective puzzle model, why two traversals needed
7. `07-lca-problems.md` - Family tree model, BST vs general BT approaches
8. `08-path-sum.md` - Trail marker model, three types of path problems
9. `09-tree-depth.md` - Tree measurement model, balanced vs unbalanced

### Enhancements per file:
- **Building Intuition** section with relatable mental models
- **When NOT to Use** section covering anti-patterns and alternatives
- ASCII tree diagrams showing transformations and operations
- Pattern matching tables for problem type to algorithm mapping

## Acceptance criteria verification

- [x] All 9 files have "Building Intuition" section before code
- [x] All 9 files have "When NOT to Use" section
- [x] ASCII tree diagrams added for operations
- [x] Complexity analysis includes height discussions

## Quality notes

- All mental models use real-world analogies (org charts, bookshelves, bouncers, etc.)
- Each "When NOT to Use" section includes common mistake scenarios
- Tables provided for quick reference during interviews
