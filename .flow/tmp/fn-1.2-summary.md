# Task fn-1.2 Completion Summary

## What was done

Enhanced 10 markdown files in `08-graphs/` with deep explanations, totaling 1,248 new lines of content.

### Files enhanced:
1. `01-graph-representations.md` - Added Phone Book Analogy mental model, trade-off analysis
2. `02-bfs-basics.md` - Wave propagation mental model, step-by-step trace, complexity proof
3. `03-dfs-basics.md` - Maze explorer mental model, recursion tree visualization, call stack trace
4. `04-connected-components.md` - Island exploration mental model, Union-Find perspective
5. `05-cycle-detection-directed.md` - Deadlock detection mental model, three-color insight
6. `06-cycle-detection-undirected.md` - Back road mental model, parent tracking explanation
7. `07-topological-sort.md` - Dependency resolution mental model, both Kahn's and DFS traces
8. `08-course-schedule.md` - University registration mental model, cycle = impossibility insight
9. `09-dijkstra.md` - Greedy expansion mental model, heap trace, optimality proof
10. `10-bellman-ford.md` - Repeated announcements mental model, V-1 iteration proof

### Enhancements per file:
- **Building Intuition** section with relatable mental models and analogies
- **When NOT to Use** section covering anti-patterns and common mistakes
- **Step-by-Step traces** with ASCII box diagrams showing algorithm state
- **Complexity derivations** with formal proofs

## Acceptance criteria verification

- [x] All 10 files have "Building Intuition" section before code
- [x] All 10 files have "When NOT to Use" section
- [x] ASCII graph traversal traces added (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort)
- [x] Complexity proofs included with formal derivations

## Quality notes

- No markdown syntax errors (verified code block pairs)
- Consistent formatting across all files
- Mental models use real-world analogies (phone books, mazes, waves, etc.)
- Proofs use mathematical notation where appropriate
