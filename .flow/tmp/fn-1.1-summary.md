# Task fn-1.1 Summary: Enhance Dynamic Programming Chapter

## Completed Work

Enhanced all 18 markdown files in `09-dynamic-programming/` with:

### 1. "Building Intuition" Sections
Each file now has a comprehensive "Building Intuition" section that explains:
- **Why** the approach works (not just how)
- Mental models and analogies for understanding
- Key insights that make the pattern "click"
- Comparisons with related techniques

### 2. "When NOT to Use" Sections
Each file now has a "When NOT to Use" section covering:
- Anti-patterns and common misapplications
- When simpler alternatives (greedy, brute force) are better
- Complexity constraints that make the approach infeasible
- Recognition patterns for when the technique IS appropriate

## Files Enhanced

1. `01-dp-fundamentals.md` - Core DP concepts
2. `02-memoization-vs-tabulation.md` - Top-down vs bottom-up
3. `03-1d-dp-basics.md` - Single-dimension DP
4. `04-house-robber.md` - Take/skip pattern
5. `05-coin-change.md` - Unbounded knapsack
6. `06-longest-increasing-subsequence.md` - LIS O(n²) and O(n log n)
7. `07-2d-dp-basics.md` - Grid and string DP foundations
8. `08-longest-common-subsequence.md` - LCS pattern
9. `09-edit-distance.md` - Levenshtein distance
10. `10-knapsack-01.md` - 0/1 knapsack
11. `11-knapsack-unbounded.md` - Unbounded knapsack
12. `12-palindrome-dp.md` - Substring/subsequence palindromes
13. `13-word-break.md` - String segmentation
14. `14-regex-matching.md` - Wildcard and regex patterns
15. `15-buy-sell-stock.md` - State machine DP
16. `16-matrix-chain.md` - Interval DP
17. `17-burst-balloons.md` - Reverse thinking interval DP
18. `18-dp-on-strings.md` - Advanced string DP

## Quality Notes

- Each "Building Intuition" section is 5-7 detailed points
- Each "When NOT to Use" section has 5 specific anti-patterns
- Added "Recognize Pattern When" boxes for quick reference
- Maintained consistent formatting with existing content
- No code changes - only added explanatory sections
