# Problem Solution Implementation Instructions

You are tasked with implementing optimal solutions to the "Practice Problems" listed in the markdown files within this repository.

## Hierarchy Mirroring
The solutions must mirror the exact hierarchy of the notes directory.
- For every notes file located at `[Topic-Folder]/[Subtopic-File].md`, you must create a corresponding solution file.
- The solution file should be named the same as the notes file (e.g., `solutions/[Topic-Folder]/[Subtopic-File].md`).
- Ensure the directory structure under `solutions/` matches the root structure (e.g., `02-arrays-strings/01-array-basics.md`).

## Content Requirements for Each Solution File
- **Completeness**: The solution file must contain the **exact same problems** and the **same number of problems** (e.g., if there are 4 problems in the notes, there must be 4 in the solution) as listed in the "Practice Problems" section of the source notes file.
- For each problem, provide the following:

1.  **Problem Title**: Clear heading for each problem.
2.  **Problem Statement**: A nicely explained description of the problem.
3.  **Examples & Edge Cases**:
    - Include various illustrative examples.
    - Explicitly list and explain edge cases.
4.  **Optimal Python Solution**:
    - Embed a Python code block with the optimal solution.
    - The solution should be "clean code" style.
    - **Comments**: Nicely comment the solution to explain the logic.
5.  **Explanation**:
    - Detailed explanation of the solution and why it works.
    - Break down the logic step-by-step.
6.  **Complexity Analysis**:
    - Mention the Time and Space complexity.
    - **Crucial**: Explain *why* the time complexity is what it is (e.g., "We traverse the array once, so it's O(n)").

## Goal
The goal is to create a comprehensive study guide where each note file has a matching solution file that provides deep understanding and ready-to-use optimal implementations.
