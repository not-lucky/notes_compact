# Appendix C: Company-Specific Patterns

Each major tech company has its own interview culture, focus areas, and evaluation criteria. Understanding these differences gives you an edge—not just in solving problems, but in how you communicate and what you emphasize.

## Why This Matters

1. **Same skill, different emphasis**: All companies test DSA, but weight factors differently
2. **Communication style**: Some prefer structured explanation, others want rapid iteration
3. **Cultural fit signals**: Understanding values helps you frame your approach
4. **Time allocation**: Knowing what matters helps you prioritize during the interview

## Company Interview Comparison

| Aspect | Google | Meta | Amazon | Microsoft | Apple |
|--------|--------|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Focus** | Algorithmic depth | Move fast, iterate | LPs + DSA | Problem decomposition | System integration |
| **Difficulty** | Hard | Medium-Hard | Medium | Medium | Medium-Hard |
| **Communication** | Structured, thorough | Quick, adaptive | STAR format | Collaborative | Thoughtful |
| **Code Quality** | Clean, optimal | Working first | Functional | Well-organized | Production-ready |
| **Unique Factor** | Googliness | Velocity | Leadership | Growth mindset | Secrecy/polish |

## The 4 Interview Philosophies

### Google: Intellectual Rigor
- Wants to see how you think about hard problems
- Values optimal solutions with proof of correctness
- Expects clear complexity analysis
- Googliness = humility + curiosity + doing the right thing

### Meta: Velocity and Impact
- Ship something that works, then optimize
- "Move fast" culture reflected in interview pacing
- Values practical tradeoffs over theoretical perfection
- Strong emphasis on system design at senior levels

### Amazon: Leadership in Action
- Every answer should demonstrate Leadership Principles
- Behavioral and technical deeply intertwined
- "Customer obsession" lens for problem framing
- Bar raiser ensures consistent hiring bar

### Microsoft/Apple: Depth and Polish
- Microsoft: collaborative problem-solving, growth mindset signals
- Apple: secretive, expects polished thinking, attention to detail
- Both value clear communication and structured approach

## Quick Reference: What to Emphasize

### When at Google
- Verbalize your thought process continuously
- Always mention time/space complexity
- Ask clarifying questions before coding
- Consider edge cases early and thoroughly

### When at Meta
- Get working code fast, optimize after
- Be comfortable thinking out loud while coding
- Show you can iterate based on feedback
- Demonstrate product sense when relevant

### When at Amazon
- Frame problems in terms of customer impact
- Weave LPs naturally into technical discussion
- Use STAR format for behavioral deep-dives
- Show ownership and bias for action

### When at Microsoft
- Ask for hints if stuck—collaboration is valued
- Show you can break problems into smaller pieces
- Demonstrate learning from past mistakes
- Be open about areas for growth

### When at Apple
- Think about production edge cases
- Show attention to detail in code quality
- Consider user experience even in technical problems
- Be comfortable with ambiguity

## Common Mistakes by Company

| Company | Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Google | Jumping to code before understanding | Spend 5+ min on clarification and approach |
| Meta | Over-engineering initial solution | Get naive solution working, then optimize |
| Amazon | Not connecting tech to LPs | Naturally weave in "ownership" and "customer" |
| Microsoft | Being defensive when given hints | Embrace feedback as collaborative problem-solving |
| Apple | Overlooking edge cases | Think about what could go wrong in production |

Begin with Google's interview philosophy, as it's the most algorithmic-heavy and sets a high bar for DSA preparation.
