# Appendix C: Company-Specific Patterns

Each major tech company has its own interview culture, focus areas, and evaluation criteria. Understanding these differences gives you an edge—not just in solving problems, but in how you communicate and what you emphasize.

## Building Intuition

### Why Company Culture Matters in Interviews

Interviews aren't just skill tests—they're culture fit assessments. A brilliant engineer who can't adapt to Google's structured communication style or Amazon's LP-focused framing will struggle, even if they solve every problem.

**The key insight**: The same technical skill can be demonstrated in ways that resonate differently at different companies. Knowing what each company values lets you frame your abilities in their language.

### How Companies Design Their Interviews

Each company's interview reflects its values:

| Company | Value | Interview Reflection |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Google | Intellectual rigor | Optimal solutions, complexity analysis |
| Meta | Velocity | Two problems per round, working code first |
| Amazon | Customer obsession | LPs woven into every answer |
| Microsoft | Growth mindset | Collaborative hints, learning from failure |
| Apple | Polish | Edge case handling, production-quality code |

Understanding this mapping lets you predict what they'll emphasize.

### Mental Model: The Interview as a Cultural Sample

Think of the interview as a sample of what working there would be like:
- At Google, you'd spend time discussing algorithmic approaches with colleagues
- At Meta, you'd ship quickly and iterate based on metrics
- At Amazon, you'd justify decisions in terms of customer impact
- At Microsoft, you'd collaborate and learn from teammates
- At Apple, you'd polish until it's perfect

The interview tests whether you'd thrive in that environment.

### Why One-Size-Fits-All Prep Fails

Generic interview prep teaches you to solve problems. Company-specific prep teaches you to solve problems *the way they want to see them solved*. The difference is often what separates offers from rejections.

## When NOT to Use Company-Specific Strategies

### Don't Over-Optimize for Culture Fit

1. **Don't be inauthentic**: If you hate the culture you're mimicking, you'll be miserable if you get the job. Use these guides to understand expectations, not to fake a personality.

2. **Don't neglect fundamentals**: Company-specific strategies are polish on top of solid DSA skills. If you can't solve the problem, the right communication style won't save you.

3. **Don't be rigid**: Each interviewer is different. If a Google interviewer seems to want you to code quickly, don't stubbornly insist on 10 minutes of clarification because "that's what Google wants."

4. **Don't ignore the problem**: Company culture matters, but the primary evaluation is still "can you solve the problem?" Don't spend so much time on LP framing at Amazon that you don't finish the code.

### Common Mistakes

- **Stereotype interviewers**: Not every Amazon interviewer obsesses over LPs; some care more about code quality
- **Force cultural signals**: Awkwardly inserting "customer obsession" into every sentence sounds rehearsed
- **Forget to adapt**: What works for L4 interviews differs from L6; adjust for level
- **Assume uniformity**: Different teams within the same company have different cultures

---

## Why This Matters

1. **Same skill, different emphasis**: All companies test DSA, but weight factors differently
2. **Communication style**: Some prefer structured explanation, others want rapid iteration
3. **Cultural fit signals**: Understanding values helps you frame your approach
4. **Time allocation**: Knowing what matters helps you prioritize during the interview

## Company Interview Comparison

| Aspect | Google | Meta | Amazon | Microsoft | Apple |
|--------|--------|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Primary Focus** | Algorithmic depth | Move fast, iterate | LPs + DSA | Problem decomposition | System integration |
| **Difficulty** | Hard | Medium-Hard | Medium | Medium | Medium-Hard |
| **Communication** | Structured, thorough | Quick, adaptive | STAR format | Collaborative | Thoughtful |
| **Code Quality** | Clean, optimal | Working first | Functional | Well-organized | Production-ready |
| **Unique Factor** | Googliness | Velocity | Leadership | Growth mindset | Secrecy/polish |

## The 4 Interview Philosophies

### Google: Intellectual Rigor
- Wants to see how you think about hard problems
- Values optimal solutions with proof of correctness
- Expects clear complexity analysis
- Googliness = humility + curiosity + doing the right thing

### Meta: Velocity and Impact
- Ship something that works, then optimize
- "Move fast" culture reflected in interview pacing
- Values practical tradeoffs over theoretical perfection
- Strong emphasis on system design at senior levels

### Amazon: Leadership in Action
- Every answer should demonstrate Leadership Principles
- Behavioral and technical deeply intertwined
- "Customer obsession" lens for problem framing
- Bar raiser ensures consistent hiring bar

### Microsoft/Apple: Depth and Polish
- Microsoft: collaborative problem-solving, growth mindset signals
- Apple: secretive, expects polished thinking, attention to detail
- Both value clear communication and structured approach

## Quick Reference: What to Emphasize

### When at Google
- Verbalize your thought process continuously
- Always mention time/space complexity
- Ask clarifying questions before coding
- Consider edge cases early and thoroughly

### When at Meta
- Get working code fast, optimize after
- Be comfortable thinking out loud while coding
- Show you can iterate based on feedback
- Demonstrate product sense when relevant

### When at Amazon
- Frame problems in terms of customer impact
- Weave LPs naturally into technical discussion
- Use STAR format for behavioral deep-dives
- Show ownership and bias for action

### When at Microsoft
- Ask for hints if stuck—collaboration is valued
- Show you can break problems into smaller pieces
- Demonstrate learning from past mistakes
- Be open about areas for growth

### When at Apple
- Think about production edge cases
- Show attention to detail in code quality
- Consider user experience even in technical problems
- Be comfortable with ambiguity

## Common Mistakes by Company

| Company | Mistake | Better Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Google | Jumping to code before understanding | Spend 5+ min on clarification and approach |
| Meta | Over-engineering initial solution | Get naive solution working, then optimize |
| Amazon | Not connecting tech to LPs | Naturally weave in "ownership" and "customer" |
| Microsoft | Being defensive when given hints | Embrace feedback as collaborative problem-solving |
| Apple | Overlooking edge cases | Think about what could go wrong in production |

Begin with Google's interview philosophy, as it's the most algorithmic-heavy and sets a high bar for DSA preparation.
