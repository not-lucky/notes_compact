# Practice Solutions

## Non-overlapping Intervals

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** total - max_keep

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** Same as activity selection

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** Heap for earliest deadline

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Key Insight:** Weighted interval scheduling

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## Video Stitching

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** Interval covering variant

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
