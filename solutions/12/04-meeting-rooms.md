# Practice Solutions

## Meeting Rooms

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Key Insight:** Sort, check adjacent overlap

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## Meeting Rooms II

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** Min-heap or sweep line

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## Car Pooling

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** Sweep line with capacity

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## My Calendar I

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Insight:** Interval insertion/overlap

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)

    """
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

## My Calendar III

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Key Insight:** Sweep line, max overlap

```python
def solution():
    """
    Time: O(TBD)
    Space: O(TBD)
