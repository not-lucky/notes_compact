# Solutions: Memoization vs Tabulation

No specific practice problems were listed for this section. This section compares the top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches to implementing DP.

Key takeaways:
- **Memoization**: Recursive, solves only needed subproblems, easier to implement from brute force.
- **Tabulation**: Iterative, solves all subproblems, easier to space-optimize to O(1) in many cases.

Refer to [03-1d-dp-basics.md](./03-1d-dp-basics.md) for practice problems implemented using both styles.
