## How to Use

1. **First Attempt** - Try solving the problem yourself for 20-45 minutes
2. **Review Solution** - Study the approach and implementation
3. **Understand Complexity** - Make sure you can explain time/space analysis
4. **Practice Edge Cases** - Review what edge cases are handled
5. **Re-implement** - Code the solution from memory
