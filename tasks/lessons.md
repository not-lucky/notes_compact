- Combination Sum problems should show state as `(start_idx, remaining_target)` or `(start_idx, current_path)`.
- Make sure to always separate Auxiliary Space from Time Complexity clearly.
- Always use `\mathcal{O}` instead of `$O(...)` for consistency.
- Avoid modifying objects by reference directly in the argument call (`path + [cands[i]]` is fine for simple prints, but in actual code `path.append` and `path.pop()` is correct).
- Make sure `i > start` logic in loops for deduplication is well-explained (it restricts skipping to horizontal siblings).
- For grid-based backtracking problems (like N-Queens, Sudoku), always clarify state mutation, constraint tracking sets (`\mathcal{O}(1)` checks), and state restoration properly in the recursive call cycle.
- Explain explicit vs implicit state restoration clearly (e.g. passing `string + '('` vs appending and popping from a list).
