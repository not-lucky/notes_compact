# Plan: Improve Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array notes

- [x] Analyze the current notes for correctness, clarity, and code readability
- [x] Fix the implementation of `findMinDuplicates` to correctly handle all cases
- [x] Improve explanations of the intuition and mental models
- [x] Update code snippets to be consistent with the binary search template (using `left <= right` with a variable to store the result, or clear explanation of why `left < right` is used as an alternative template)
- [x] Review and fix `findMax` and `findRotationCount` implementations
- [x] Run `python update_script.py` to ensure all links are valid? (or just verify manually)

## Review
The notes for `10-binary-search/04-find-minimum-rotated.md` have been updated. The explanations now explicitly link the concept to the binary search templates (specifically Template 2: Find Left Boundary and Template 3: Find Right Boundary) introduced in the first lesson. The code has been refactored for clarity and to better fit the templates, and comments have been improved.
