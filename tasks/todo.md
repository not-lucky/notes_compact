# Plan for fixing 06-trees/03-level-order-traversal.md

- [x] Standardize Big-O notations to `$\mathcal{O}(N)$` / `$\Theta(N)$` format.
- [x] Ensure all Python code blocks have modern type hints (`Optional[TreeNode]`, `deque` typing if needed). Need to add a mock `TreeNode` class definition at the top of the snippets or specify imports.
- [x] Add `from typing import Optional` to snippets where applicable.
- [x] Clarify time and space complexities, specifically mentioning call stack depth (`$\mathcal{O}(H)$` space where $H$ is the height of the tree) vs queue space (`$\mathcal{O}(W)$`).
- [x] Ensure code blocks are runnable Python syntax.
- [x] Test the python snippets to ensure they compile and run correctly.
- [x] Update `tasks/todo.md` as items are completed.

# Plan: Update 06-trees/06-tree-construction.md
- [x] Read `tasks/lessons.md` to ensure all conventions are met.
- [x] Analyze `06-trees/06-tree-construction.md` to identify areas for improvement.
- [x] Improve explanations, correctness, and code readability.
- [x] Standardize Big-O notation using mathcal format (e.g., `$\mathcal{O}(n)$` or `$\Theta(n)$`).
- [x] Add modern Python type hints to code examples (e.g., `Optional[TreeNode]`, `list[int]`).
- [x] Ensure time and space complexities are accurately represented, noting amortized or average vs worst-case where appropriate. Account for call stack depth in space complexity (e.g., `$\mathcal{O}(h)$`).
- [x] Ensure code blocks use valid, runnable Python syntax. Include a `TreeNode` definition at the top if needed for the examples to be runnable, or ensure it's implied by imports.
- [x] Execute bash tests to verify Python code is runnable.
- [x] Update `tasks/todo.md` with the completed plan and review.
- [x] Review lessons and add any new lessons to `tasks/lessons.md`.
