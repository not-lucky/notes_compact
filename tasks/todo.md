- [x] Identify Areas for Improvement
    - [x] Reorder sections for a better learning path (Core Concept -> Intuition -> Representation -> Operations -> Build Heap -> Class -> Comparisons)
    - [x] Standardize and fix the `pop` logic between the standalone function and the class method
    - [x] Improve the "Why O(n) Build Heap" explanation with a visual representation of work done at each level
