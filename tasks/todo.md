# Improve Chapter 09 Dynamic Programming Notes

- [x] Improve `01-dp-fundamentals.md`
- [x] Improve `02-memoization-vs-tabulation.md`
- [x] Improve `03-1d-dp-basics.md`
- [x] Improve `04-house-robber.md`
- [x] Improve `05-coin-change.md`
- [x] Improve `06-longest-increasing-subsequence.md`
- [x] Improve `07-2d-dp-basics.md`
- [x] Improve `08-longest-common-subsequence.md`
- [x] Improve `09-edit-distance.md`
- [x] Improve `10-knapsack-01.md`
- [x] Improve `11-knapsack-unbounded.md`
  - [x] Add 2D DP solution before the 1D space-optimized one. This bridges the gap between Top-Down and Space-Optimized.
  - [x] Refine the recurrence notation ($i$ vs $i-1$) and explain it better. Use standard 0-indexed terms.
  - [x] Clarify "Building Intuition" to distinguish core knapsack (max value) from combinations/permutations (counting).
  - [x] Rewrite code with descriptive docstrings, type hints.
  - [x] Improve DP Table Visualization readability and walkthrough.
- [x] Improve `12-palindrome-dp.md`
- [x] Improve `13-word-break.md`
- [x] Improve `14-regex-matching.md`
  - [x] Rewrite "Building Intuition" to clearly explain why this is a DP problem (overlapping subproblems from branching).
  - [x] Fix DP Recurrence formulation for Regex (it mentions $dp[i][j]$ is `True` if prefix matches, but base cases mix up string vs pattern indices). Clarify $i$ is string index, $j$ is pattern index.
  - [x] Improve the "Star Match" explanation. It says we drop `x*` from pattern for zero occurrences, which is `dp[i][j-2]`. Correct. But for one or more occurrences it says we check `match` and `dp[i-1][j]`. Let's verify `dp[i-1][j]` vs `dp[i-1][j-1]` or other options. If `a` matches `a`, we consume `a` from string but keep `a*` in pattern, so we check `dp[i-1][j]`. Yes.
  - [x] Fix tabulation python code readability. Use clearer variable names.
  - [x] Fix the space optimization python code logic.
  - [x] Fix Wildcard DP Transitions: $dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] \lor dp[i-1][j]$. This is correct. `*` matches empty sequence (`dp[i][j-1]`) or matches current char (`dp[i-1][j]`).
  - [x] Make the Visual Walkthrough tables more readable and intuitive. Add explanations of how we trace back.
  - [x] Update Complexity table. The notes for Tabulation and Memoization and 1D are a bit weirdly formatted.
- [x] Improve `15-buy-sell-stock.md`
  - [x] Add explicit state machine diagrams for all variants (not just cooldown).
  - [x] Clearly define what "State Machine DP" actually is.
  - [x] Improve variable naming (`hold` and `cash` are okay, but `held` and `sold`/`empty` might be better or clearly explained).
  - [x] Explain the Space Optimization from O(N) to O(1) explicitly.
  - [x] Fix the explanation of `hold` and `cash` for stock 2.
  - [x] Add explicit time/space complexity blocks.
  - [x] Improve Python examples with better comments and typing.
  - [x] Clarify the reverse iteration for Stock III and IV.
  - [x] Make the DP table/state transition clearer.
- [x] Improve `16-matrix-chain.md`
- [ ] Improve `17-burst-balloons.md`
- [x] Improve `18-dp-on-strings.md`
- [x] Improve `README.md`
