# Plan: Improve 10-binary-search/07-matrix-search.md

- [x] 1. Fix Type 2 Search Matrix complexity explanation. Explain that two binary searches is O(log m + log n) = O(log(m*n)).
- [x] 2. Improve Kth Smallest Element code comments about integer division.
- [x] 3. Add a note about Search Matrix II optimizations when matrices are highly skewed (m << n), where O(m log n) binary search per row might be faster than O(m+n) staircase.
- [x] 4. Clean up Markdown and Math formatting.
- [x] 5. Refine explanations in general.
