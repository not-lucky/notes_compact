### Summary Review (01 and 02):
- **01-dp-fundamentals.md:** Corrected variable casing $O(N) \to O(n)$ for consistency. Standardized headings. Fixed typos and improved explanations for `Constraints` and `@functools.lru_cache` usage in interviews.
- **02-memoization-vs-tabulation.md:** Corrected variable casing $O(N) \to O(n)$ and $M \times N \to m \times n$. Added "Chapter 09:" to the title. Improved the explanation for boundary conditions under the pitfalls section. Both files now have a cohesive tone suitable for a high-quality DP study guide.
