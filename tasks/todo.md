# Plan for 11-recursion-backtracking/06-n-queens.md

- [x] Check code blocks for correctness and O(1) index pointers.
- [x] Fix formatting of ASCII trees (ensure they use standard tree drawing like `|`, `/`, `\`, make them clean and visually accurate).
- [x] Check time and space complexity sections. Update to use strict math formatting (`$O(...)` -> `$\mathcal{O}(...)$`), separating auxiliary space from total space.
- [x] Improve explanation of state validation and constraints checking.
- [x] Review the entire document for clarity, tone, and flow.

Lessons / Notes for `tasks/lessons.md`:
- Combination Sum problems should show state as `(start_idx, remaining_target)` or `(start_idx, current_path)`.
- Make sure to always separate Auxiliary Space from Time Complexity clearly.
- Always use `\mathcal{O}` instead of `$O(...)` for consistency.
